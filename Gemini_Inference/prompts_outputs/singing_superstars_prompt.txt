## **2️⃣ How to Select the Best Moments?**  
Choose segments based on these key criteria:

✅ **Audience & Judges' Reactions** – Clapping, standing ovations, emotional expressions, or uncontrollable laughter.  
✅ **Performance Impact** – If a contestant receives high praise, a golden buzzer, or an unexpected reaction from judges.  
✅ **Engagement Factor** – Moments that are shareable, meme-worthy, or highly engaging for viewers.  
✅ **Self-Contained** – Clips should be **independent**, meaning they start where the buildup begins and end after the climax or audience reaction.  

⚠️ **Avoid minor applause or forgettable moments. Focus on the BIGGEST highlights!**

## **3️⃣ Editing Guidelines**  
🔸 **Ensure smooth transitions** – The clip should not start or end abruptly; it should include necessary context.  
🔸 **Keep jokes & performances intact** – If a moment builds up, retain both setup and payoff.  
🔸 **No unnecessary trimming** – Make sure laughter, reactions, or judge comments are not cut off abruptly.  


*REALLY IMPORTANT - While writing the description of the shorts, please make sure that if you are mentioning something important then use a backqoute (``) and not double or single qoutes ('' "") for any type of thing like movie names, actors etc.
