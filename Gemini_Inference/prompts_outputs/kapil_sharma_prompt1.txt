IMPORTANT NOTES
* FOCUS ON QUALITY NOT QUANTITY, that is make sure that the output actually captures the most funny moments of the video.
* MAKE SURE THAT THE STARTING AND ENDING OF THE OUTPUT CLIP are not abrupt. The start of the video should be totally independent of the previous moments and should start when the joke or the buildup starts and the end should be after showing the reaction and laughter of the audience and the guests.
* All the segments should be self-contained. That is the viewer should not need any previous context to understand that clip.
* ‚è≥ **If a joke builds over time, keep the entire setup & punchline together while keeping the ending of the clip as the loudest laughter in that segment** instead of trimming too much.
* Ensure that you choose the segments whose length is between 20 to 60 seconds so as to capture the broader arc and the joke rather than just punchline or short chuckles.

*REALLY IMPORTANT - While writing the description of the shorts, please make sure that if you are mentioning something important then use a backqoute (``) and not double or single qoutes ('' "") for any type of thing like movie names, actors etc.
